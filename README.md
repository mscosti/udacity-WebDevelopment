udacity-WebDevelopment
======================

Project assignments completed while taking the Web Development Class taught by Steve Huffman on Udacity.com, 
using Python and Google App Engine (GAE).

The project is currently deployed, and can be found at mscosti-udacity.appspot.com

Since all projects completed in the class are all hosted on GAE project, they each have their own specific permalink to access them listed below, which tacks on to the end of mscosti-udacity.appspot.com

'/unit2/Birthday'     -> HTML Forms, Validation, and Get Requests
'/unit2/rot13'        -> Rot13 encryption and decryption toy
'/unit3/jinjaTest'    -> Jinja templating sandbox
'/unit3/asciichan'    -> using GAE Datastore and APIs to allow users to post ascii art, and marks the user's location
                         on a map.
'/blog'               -> A simple blog website that allows submission and creates permalinks for each post, and uses
                         memcache to avoid hitting the database on page loads.
'/wiki'               -> Final project. A wiki website where signed in users can create and edit any page they choose.      
                         supports logging all changes to each page, which can all be viewed by the user.

To run and deploy locally, you must have Google App Engine for Python installed. Then you should be able to launch and run the projects on your local host.
